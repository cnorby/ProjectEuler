This repsoitory will hold my solutions to the ever-interesting problems posed on projecteuler.net

These are mathematical problems that require the use of computers.  Each problem has an integer solution and programs must run in under 60 seconds.  ANy programming language may be used - I'll be running javascript (to start, at least) because I use it a lot at work and would love to learn more about its inner workings, performance considerations, and limitations. Locally, I'm running these JS programs via Node.
